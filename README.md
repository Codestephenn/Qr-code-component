## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped reinforce the importance of responsive design and how to use Flexbox for centering content. Here's an example of the CSS I used to center the card:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my responsive design skills and explore more advanced CSS layout techniques, such as CSS Grid. I also want to get more comfortable with accessibility best practices to ensure my projects are usable by everyone.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This resource helped me understand how to use Flexbox to center elements on the page.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used Google Fonts to easily integrate the "Outfit" font into my project.
